# Minecraft 1.12.2 Mod Template
This is a template mod built for myself to use in learning Minecraft modding. Once all standard mod parts are built out in this template, it will be used as the starting point for all MillerMods projects.
## Disclaimer
I am new to Minecraft modding, and this template mod is my first go at a full mod. If anything is broken, please commit a fix or give me a heads up!
